# Base Wars

Base Wars is a game which features four teams fighting for domination through the use of tagging. This game is similar to Infection, but there are some twists to it. For example, having four teams means you can take back someone once they are in the other team.

## Rules

When you play the game, you are asked to select your team. The four teams to choose from are Team Red, Team Yellow, Team Green, and Team Blue. For each team, there will be six players, but they are operated through AI. Players are randomly positioned across their base after the countdown. You, as one of the selected team's players, will move using arrow keys or WASD.
